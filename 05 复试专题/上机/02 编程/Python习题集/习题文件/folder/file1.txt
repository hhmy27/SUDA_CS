Parsing is an important problem in natural language
processing which has been studied extensively for
decades. Between the two basic paradigms of parsing, constituency parsing, the subject of this paper,
has in general proved to be the more difficult than
dependency parsing, both in terms of accuracy and
the run time of parsing algorithms.
